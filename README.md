# Early Athlete Injury Prediction: Interpretable Modeling via SHAP Analysis

Developed an interpretable machine learning system to predict early athlete injury risks by analyzing training and performance data. Used SHAP analysis to explain feature importance and improve model transparency.

## ⏱ Duration
July’25 – Nov’25

## 🧾 Description
- Built ML models to predict injury risk based on training/performance features
- Used SHAP for feature importance and interpretability
- Focus on explainability for coaches and sports staff

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- SHAP
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for plots)

## 📂 Project Structure
- `data/` – dataset (or sample)
- `model_training.py`
- `shap_analysis.py`
- `notebooks/` (optional)
- `requirements.txt`

## ▶️ How to Run
Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Train model:
python model_training.py

Run SHAP analysis:
python shap_analysis.py
